        "description": "Bahujan Story Hour is a monthly initiative that welcomes Bahujans to reverberate, rejoice, share and talk about their experiences and understandings on a unique topic curated for every story hour. <It is a space to amplify and strengthen Bahujan voices> (subject to change). Participation at the story hour does not require any prior experience or qualification as a speaker but requires basic working/oral knowledge of English. In addition, the selected speakers will be provided with guidance and mentorship support for writing and speaking prior to when the story hour shall be conducted. We aim to archive each story hour in the form of a podcast, as an effort to document the valued experiences shared by the speakers and make those accessible to a wider audience. ",
